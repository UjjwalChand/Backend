after copying 5 commands from github on ec2 machine 

sudo ./svc.sh install

sudo ./svc.sh start

this will start the runner


Hints for changing the maven.yml file

1) remove the following:

pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]


2) change the the following :

runs-on: ubuntu-latest -> runs-on: self-hosted


3) remove the optional setting in the end:

 # Optional: Uploads the full dependency graph to GitHub to improve the quality of Dependabot alerts this repository can receive
    - name: Update dependency graph
      uses: advanced-security/maven-dependency-submission-action@571e99aab1055c2e71a1e2309b9691de18d6b7d6


4)fix the pom path : by default it is just pom.xml 

it should be <project_name>/pom.xml



commit the above changes and a new build should be triggered in github

Once that is done : the _work/.....target/<some>.jar file should be created


the aim is to use the jar file path and put it in the maven.yml file path


yml deployment step example :

- name: Execute Jar file
      run: sudo kill -9 `sudo lsof -t -i:8080` & sudo java -jar /home/ubuntu/actions-runner/_work/todo-app-fs-11-first-deploy/todo-app-fs-11-first-deploy/todoApp/target/todoApp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &


just change the path after _work/ to whatever your jar path is !!

and commit the change, this will again start the build and deploy as well because of the modified yml file

if everything was done correctly, this is all that is needed
